// Lets the user manage permissions by asking in chat ("turn off PowerShell",
// "let the agent edit files here"). The asymmetry is deliberate:
//   - Turning a permission OFF only ever reduces what the agent can do, so it
//     applies immediately.
//   - Turning a permission ON is `mutating` with no always-allow rule, so every
//     call pauses for the user's explicit Allow / Decline in the UI. Text in a
//     file or web page can never grant the agent more power on its own.
// Changes take effect from the next message: a run's tool list is fixed when
// it starts (the executor still re-checks permissions on every call).
